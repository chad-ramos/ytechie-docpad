This is the source for the [YTechie.com developer blog](http://www.ytechie.com/). It's set up so that I can easily add/edit content, check it into GitHub, and have Azure automatically pull the source and deploy it.

This is based off the website of [Erv Walter](http://www.ewal.net/).

###Installation

If you want to deploy to Azure to try it:

<a href="https://azuredeploy.net/" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>

For a production installation, you'll want to customize the site:

1. Download the source
2. Run *npm install* in the folder
3. Customize src\partials\me.html
4. Replace your photo in src\files\images\Headshot-Square.jpg (100x100px)
5. Customize the default page template
 * Change the Google Analytics code to your own
 * Change the Google Plus information to your own
 * Change the feed title
 * Change the meta description
 * Change the twitter and github info
 * Change the search site
 * Change copyright
6. Customize the rewrites in src\files\web.config (if using IIS, and only if needed)
